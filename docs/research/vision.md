# Bone & Barrow
## Vision Document

*A game about commanding death, not dealing it.*

---

## What This Game Is

**Bone & Barrow is a necromancer action roguelite where death feeds power.**

You are a lonely lich defending your graveyard from "heroic" invaders. But you're not a villain—you're a tired caretaker trying to protect the peaceful dead. When paladins and priests kick down your gates to "cleanse evil," you raise their fallen comrades and turn the invasion against itself.

**The core fantasy:** Start each run alone and fragile. End it commanding a skeletal legion 20+ strong, overwhelming your attackers through sheer numbers and strategy.

**The core emotion:** Watching your army grow from nothing to unstoppable—then doing it all over again, but differently.

---

## The Hook (Why Someone Would Play This)

**In one sentence:**
"I raise my enemies as skeleton minions mid-combat and command them like a horde."

**The viral moment:**
You're at 10% health, three skeletons left, paladins closing in. You make a desperate stand, drop two enemies, raise them instantly, and suddenly you have five skeletons. They swarm the next enemy. Six skeletons. Seven. The tide turns. By the end, fifteen skeletons are marching with you. You didn't just survive—you *grew stronger through adversity.*

**That's the game.** Every kill is a recruitment. Every corpse is potential.

---

## Who This Is For

### **The Burnt-Out Hades Player**
They love roguelites but are tired of 40-minute runs where dying at the end feels like punishment. They want:
- Shorter sessions (10-15 minutes)
- Variety without repetition
- Stakes without cruelty

**Bone & Barrow gives them:** Quick runs with real tension, but even "bad" runs give progress. No grinding the same opening 30 times.

### **The Vampire Survivors Fan**
They love horde power fantasy and watching numbers go up. They want:
- Growing power within each run
- Visual spectacle (tons of units on screen)
- "One more run" loop

**Bone & Barrow gives them:** You ARE the horde. Your army visibly grows from 1 skeleton to 20+. But with more active control than VS's autopilot.

### **The Cult of the Lamb Enjoyer**
They want dark fantasy that's charming, not grimdark. They want:
- Cute-but-creepy aesthetic
- Sympathetic "villain" protagonist
- Humor mixed with darkness

**Bone & Barrow gives them:** A grumpy lich in a bathrobe, goofy wobbling skeletons, and overzealous paladins getting swarmed by the dead they came to "save."

---

## The Pillars (What Makes This Different)

### **1. Death Is Your Economy**
In most action games, killing enemies clears the board. Here, killing is *harvesting*. Every corpse is a potential soldier. The more you kill, the stronger you get—within that single run.

**Why this matters:** It creates a positive feedback loop that feels amazing. You're not managing resources—you're *creating* them through good play.

### **2. You Command, You Don't Build**
This isn't tower defense. You're not placing static turrets and watching. Your skeletons follow YOU. You run into the fray, your army crashes in behind you. You're Aragorn leading the charge, not an RTS player clicking from above.

**Why this matters:** Every second you're making decisions. Where to position. Who to target. When to raise more. It's active, not passive.

### **3. Runs Are Tense, Failure Is Gentle**
You can absolutely fail. Hard. At minute 3. Your Crypt Heart can be destroyed early, ending the run in disaster. But:
- You still get gold (scaled to performance)
- You still get a story beat (your necromancer reflects on what went wrong)
- You still learned something (tactical knowledge for next time)

**Why this matters:** Stakes create drama. Forgiveness creates "one more run" instead of "I'm done."

### **4. Power Grows, Challenge Scales**
Your army grows from 1 skeleton to 20+ within a run. But having 20 skeletons doesn't mean "I won." Late waves introduce enemies that counter large armies—AOE attacks that wipe groups, executioners that target your skeletons, overwhelming numbers that tax even a large force.

**Why this matters:** The power fantasy stays satisfying, but the game stays tense. You're never on autopilot.

### **5. No Two Runs Feel Identical**
Your starting position changes. Wave composition changes. Shop upgrades are different. But it never feels *unfair*—just varied. You're not grinding the same content 50 times. You're exploring possibilities.

**Why this matters:** Hades' biggest flaw is repetitive early game. This avoids that by injecting variety from second one.

### **6. Cute Darkness, Not Grimdark**
The tone is Cult of the Lamb meets Don't Starve. Dark fantasy, yes. But cartoonish. Expressive. Skeletons are goofy helpers with big skulls and wobbling walks. Paladins panic comically when swarmed. Your necromancer is a tired, sarcastic custodian, not an evil overlord.

**Why this matters:** Dark-but-charming has a huge audience. It's accessible without being childish. Scary without being stressful.

---

## The Core Loop (What Playing Feels Like)

### **Starting a Run**
You're in your crypt. Candlelight. Your journal open. Outside, you hear the gates being battered.

You choose:
- Which crypt to start from (north, south, east)
- One starting bonus (extra skeletons, bonus souls, shield on your Heart)

**The choice creates variety, but none are "wrong."** Just different strategies.

---

### **Wave 1: The First Test**
The gates burst open. Squires pour in—shiny armor, heroic poses, but dopey faces.

**You're alone.** Just you and your staff, firing purple soul bolts.

You drop one. His corpse hits the ground. You press E. Purple energy swirls. He rises—but now he's *yours*. A skeleton. Wobbling. Following you.

You drop two more. Raise them. Now three skeletons march behind you.

The squires thin out. An archer appears at the back, shooting at you. You send your skeletons forward while you flank. They dogpile the archer. Four skeletons now.

**A lull.** No more spawns for 20 seconds. You breathe. Raise the remaining corpses. Six skeletons now, standing with you. You reposition to the gate.

**Another burst.** More enemies. But this time you have backup. Your skeletons swarm. You pick off stragglers. The wave ends.

**The shop appears.** Three glowing cards:
- Heal 50% HP
- +20% skeleton damage
- Unlock Mass Raise (raise 3 corpses at once)

You pick damage. Your skeletons glow briefly—stronger now.

---

### **Wave 3: The Breaking Point**
By now, you have 12 skeletons. You feel powerful. Then the priests arrive.

They chant. Purple light erupts. **Half your army crumbles to dust.**

Panic. You're exposed. Squires rush the Crypt Heart. You intercept, desperately raising corpses to rebuild. You focus fire the priest. He falls. You raise him.

Now you have a *skeleton mage*—he slows enemies.

You stabilize. The wave ends. But barely. Your Heart is at 60% HP.

**The shop:** You take the healing option. You need it.

---

### **Wave 5: Dawn or Destruction**
It's minute 12. You've survived this long before, but never reached dawn.

Enemies swarm from two gates. Paladins in front, archers behind, priests in the center. Your army is 18 skeletons strong, but priests start chanting—your front line crumbles in purple light. This wave doesn't care how many you have; it's designed to overwhelm even a full army.

You use your spell—Soul Drain—to lifesteal and stay alive. Your skeletons shred the paladins. You raise them. Now 22 skeletons.

The Crypt Heart takes a hit. 30% HP. Another hit. 15%.

A paladin breaks through. He's charging your Heart. You have one second. You sprint, body-block him, your skeletons swarm. He falls.

**The sun rises. Dawn breaks. You survived.**

Gold floods in. 1200g. A new skeleton type unlocks. Your journal updates: *"I held the line. They will return. I will be ready."*

---

### **Between Runs**
You're back in your study. You spend gold:
- Upgrade skeleton damage (rank 2)
- Unlock Skeleton Brutes (tanky units)
- Buy a new spell (Bone Barrier)

Next run, you'll start stronger. But waves will still challenge you.

---

## Why Runs Don't Get Boring

### **Problem: Hades Repetition**
Hades makes you replay rooms 1-10 identically every single run. By run 20, you're on autopilot.

### **Solution: Constrained Randomness**

**Every run, these change:**
- **Start position** (north/south/east crypt) → different tactical layout
- **Start bonus** (skeletons vs souls vs shield) → different opening strategy
- **Wave composition** (15 weak squires vs 10 squires + 5 archers) → different threat patterns
- **Wave modifiers** (reinforced, flanking, rapid) → different twists
- **Shop upgrades** (heal vs damage vs utility) → different build paths

**But it's constrained:**
- Wave 1 always has ~100 "threat points" (never unfairly hard)
- Shop always offers 1 power / 1 army / 1 utility pick (never dead rolls)
- Start bonuses are balanced sidegrades (never "bad RNG")

**Result:** After 20 runs, you haven't seen the same game 20 times. You've seen 20 variations.

**Tension Stays High:**
Even after you've unlocked upgrades and start runs stronger, waves are designed to challenge armies of any size. Having 20 skeletons feels powerful, but it doesn't trivialize the challenge—you're just fighting different threats. Early waves test your ability to BUILD an army. Late waves test your ability to MAINTAIN it under pressure.

---

## Why Failure Doesn't Feel Bad

### **Problem: Harsh Roguelites**
Traditional roguelites reset you to zero on death. You "wasted" 30 minutes.

### **Solution: Scaled Rewards + Story Beats**

**If you die at Wave 1 (minute 2):**
- You get 50 gold
- Your journal says: *"They came faster than expected. Tomorrow I'll raise archers first."*
- You learned: "I should prioritize ranged units early."

**If you die at Wave 3 (minute 8):**
- You get 350 gold
- Your journal says: *"The priests devastated my army. I need to focus-fire them."*
- You learned: "Kill priests first."

**If you survive to Dawn (minute 15):**
- You get 1200 gold + bonus unlock
- Your journal says: *"For one night, the graveyard is safe. But they'll return stronger."*
- You feel: **TRIUMPHANT.**

**Even disaster runs contribute.** 50 gold × 4 runs = 200g = an upgrade. Progress is guaranteed. Just faster when you perform well.

---

## The Pacing (How Waves Feel)

### **Problem: Constant Spawning Is Exhausting**
If enemies spawn continuously for 3 minutes, players burn out. No time to appreciate your army or make strategic decisions.

### **Solution: Burst-Lull-Burst**

**Each wave is pulses, not a flood:**

**Burst (45 seconds):** High spawn rate. Intense combat. Music swells.  
**Lull (20 seconds):** No spawns. Cleanup. Raise corpses. Reposition. Breathe.  
**Burst (50 seconds):** Harder enemies. Higher intensity.  
**Lull (20 seconds):** Stabilize. Assess.  
**Burst (60 seconds):** Peak intensity. Climax. Survive or die here.  

**Shop (15 seconds):** Pick upgrade. Prepare for next wave.

**Why this works:**
- Peak fighting = ~2 minutes per wave (manageable)
- Lulls = time to feel powerful (look at your 15-skeleton army!)
- Escalation = each burst harder than the last (drama)

**Compare to Vampire Survivors:**
- VS: Continuous chaos, passive play
- This: Rhythmic intensity, active play

---

## The Progression (Why You Keep Playing)

### **Within a Run: Build Crafting**
You start weak. By wave 5, you're godlike. But HOW you get there changes:

**Run 1:** You draft healing + tank skeletons → survive through attrition  
**Run 2:** You draft damage + fast raise speed → aggressive swarm  
**Run 3:** You draft Mass Raise + skeleton mages → control-heavy  

Same waves. Different strategies. Different feel.

### **Across Runs: Unlocking Options**

**First 5 runs:** You buy power upgrades (+damage, +HP, +souls)  
→ Waves get easier. You can survive longer.

**Runs 6-15:** You unlock new skeleton types (archers, brutes, mages, rogues)  
→ Waves don't get easier, but you have MORE WAYS to handle them.

**Runs 16+:** You unlock spells, start bonuses, cosmetics  
→ You're crafting builds, expressing yourself, perfecting runs.

**The key:** Power caps. You can't upgrade damage forever. Eventually progression shifts from "getting stronger" to "getting more options."

**Why this matters:** Keeps early waves challenging even after 30 runs. You're not trivializing content—you're mastering it.

---

## The Tone (What This Feels Like)

### **You Are Not a Villain**
You're not conquering the world. You're not gleefully torturing heroes. You're a tired caretaker doing your job. The "heroes" are the invaders. You're defending what's sacred.

**Your necromancer's journal entries reflect this:**
- *"Another night. Another invasion. Don't they realize these people deserve rest?"*
- *"I raised the knight who fell at my gates. He serves better in death than he did in life."*
- *"The clerics call me evil. But I've never disturbed a grave. They're the ones looting."*

### **Your Skeletons Are Helpers, Not Horrors**
They're goofy. Big skulls, small bodies. They wobble when they walk. When raised, they pop up with a little "?" expression. When they die, they crumble with a sad *bonk*.

Think: minions from Overlord, not walkers from The Walking Dead.

### **Your Enemies Are Comedic, Not Cruel**
Paladins are overzealous Boy Scouts. Priests are pearl-clutching moralists. Squires are eager rookies in over their heads.

When your horde swarms them, they panic comically—not graphically. They poof into smoke and loot, not gore.

**The vibe:** Monty Python meets Diablo. Dark, but playful.

## What Makes This Shippable (Scope Reality Check)

### **This Game Is Small On Purpose**

**One environment:** A graveyard. Fog hides everything. Static graves as obstacles. That's it.

**Three enemy types:** Squire (melee), Archer (ranged), Priest (AOE). Recolors for variety.

**Five skeleton types:** Warrior, Archer, Brute, Mage, Rogue. Start with one, unlock others.

**Five waves:** Same arena, escalating difficulty. No "levels" to design.

**One gameplay loop:** Fight → Raise → Command → Repeat.

### **The Art Is Achievable**

**Style:** 2D sprites in a 3D world (billboarding). Like Don't Starve or Cult of the Lamb.

**Pipeline:**
1. AI generates sprite ("cute skeleton warrior, Cult of the Lamb style")
2. Cleanup in Aseprite (15 minutes)
3. Import to Godot
4. Add 2-frame walk cycle

**Time per character:** 2-3 hours.  
**Total characters:** ~10 (you + 5 skeletons + 3 enemies + variants).  
**Total art time:** ~30-40 hours across 6 months.

### **The Systems Are Simple**

**Player:** Move, shoot, cast spell, raise corpses.  
**Skeletons:** Follow player, attack nearest enemy.  
**Enemies:** Pathfind to Crypt Heart, attack obstacles.  
**Shop:** Pick 1 of 3 cards.  
**Meta:** Spend gold on upgrades.

**No crafting. No skill trees. No complex AI. No procedural generation beyond spawn patterns.**

### **The Technical Constraints**

The game needs to support 50+ units on screen at 60 FPS. This is achievable because skeletons use simple follow behavior (not complex pathfinding), and enemies share precalculated paths. These aren't "features"—they're baseline technical requirements that must work in the first prototype.

This is scoped for ONE PERSON to finish in SIX MONTHS.

## Why This Will Work

### **It Rides Proven Trends**
- Roguelites are massive (Hades, Vampire Survivors, Slay the Spire)
- Horde gameplay is hot (VS sold millions, Brotato, Army of Ruin)
- Dark-but-cute aesthetics sell (Cult of the Lamb, Don't Starve)
- Short sessions fit modern players (10-15 min runs)

### **It Solves Real Frustrations**
- Not long (vs Hades' 40-min runs)
- Not repetitive (vs Hades' identical opening)
- Not punishing (vs traditional roguelites)
- Not passive (vs Vampire Survivors' autopilot)

### **It Has a Unique Hook**
"Raise your enemies mid-combat" is instantly understandable and fresh. The GIF sells itself: skeleton army swarming paladins.

### **It's Emotionally Satisfying**
- Tension: "Can I survive this wave?"
- Relief: "I made it through!"
- Pride: "Look at my army!"
- Mastery: "I'm getting better each run."
